    </p>
 
    <h1>Cebu's best beaches</h1>
    	<p>For accommodations outside the hustle and bustle of city activities, Cebu has a variety of options. Many establishments within the metro or even farther away in Cebu's southern and northern towns provide the ultimate getaway and relaxation experience.</p> 
    	
    	<p>Several resorts offer activities that allow guests to commune with nature or satisfy their craving for adventures and thrills.</p>
    	
    	<p>Cebu is synonymous with white sand beach, long shorelines, beautiful resorts, and paradise islands. It is for these reasons that the province always lands in every tourist’s list of top destinations. This premier province in Central Visayas is blessed with rich marine resources and fine beaches that tourists, both local and foreign, really make time to visit Cebu and explore its natural wonders.</p>
    	
    	<p>A trip to Cebu is incomplete without going to the beach, watching the sunset, or enjoying the panoramic view offered by world-class resorts here.</p>
    	
    	<p>Choosing where to go, however, is both a tough and easy task. It is tough to choose where to go with the many beach destinations that are all worth visiting. But it is also easy since many resorts are located very near the metro, making a jaunt to the beach possible even on a tight schedule.</p>
    	
    	<h2>Mactan</h2>
    	<p>As soon as you get off from the airplane, a line-up of resorts will welcome you in Mactan Island, where the airport is located and where first class as well as affordable beach resorts are found. Going to and from Mactan Island is easy as two bridges connect it to mainland Cebu -- the Mandaue-Mactan Bridge and Marcelo B. Fernan Bridge.</p>
    	
    	<p>Mactan Island consists of Lapu-Lapu City and Cordova town. From Cebu city, Mactan is about 45 minutes to an hour's drive. Most resorts here are just 15 to 30 minutes ride away from the Mactan-Cebu International Airport.</p>
    	
    	<p>When it comes to the ultimate in bliss and comfort, nothing beats the top resorts in Lapu-Lapu City. If money is not an issue, try any of these first class resorts in Mactan island.</p>

    	<h2>Malapascua Island</h2>
    	<p>A diver’s haven is the best way to describe this island destination in the northeastern tip of Cebu province. Initially known for its clear and white sand beach, Malapascua later on was discovered for its beautiful dive spots. This island might be small that you could tour the whole area in about two hours on foot, but coming here is guaranteed to be an unforgettable underwater experience.</p>
    	
    	<p>Among the famous dive sites here are Monad Shoal where there are daily sightings of Thresher Sharks and Manta Rays; the Gato Island, which is a sea snake sanctuary; and Kimud Shoal whose main attraction is the hammerheads.</p>

    	<h2>Bantayan Island</h2>
    	<p>Cebu may be known as an island resort province, but locals know that you haven’t had a taste of island life until you’ve been to Bantayan Island. Located northwest of Cebu mainland, Bantayan is the go-to place for those seeking a complete tropical island experience. Bantayan is composed of three towns---Sta. Fe, Bantayan and Madridejos. All three offer visitors a mix of white sand beaches, historical sites and a culture that is uniquely their own.</p>
    	
    	<p>It’s mostly peace and quiet throughout the year, but prepare for a rush of tourist activity as the Holy Week and summer months approach because everyone who’s anyone is most likely there this time of year.</p>
