 	<h1>Go shopping, buy <em>pasalubong</em></h1>
 	
 	<p>Cebuanos love a bargain but won't sacrifice quality. It is this value-for-money characteristic that makes it possible for ukay-ukay (second-hand dresses) displays, tabo (cheap clothes stalls), and shops selling imported goods to co-exist and thrive.</p>
 	      <p>It is not uncommon for young professionals in Cebu to own branded shirts, dresses, and bags bought from imported shops like Mango, Promod, and Kipling as well as similar items bought for a dime at flea markets. Cebu's bargain stores selling at retail or bulk prices that are often subjected to haggling give as much color to its shopping scene as the big shopping malls that have sprouted up all over the metro.</p>
 	      <p>Shopping in the mall is easy, convenient, and comfortable and there are a lot of big stores to choose from in Cebu City.</p>

 	        Shamrock Bakery and Restaurant Corporation takes pride in its more than 50 years of excellent baking. It is famous for its &quot;otap&quot; - a crisk, flaky, and saccharine-coated biscuit that is a specialty of Cebu - and has expanded its take-home delicacies to include hojaldres, galletas de huevo, baked polvoron, lady’s finger, patatas, rosquillos, and other baked products.</p>
 	      <p>Its pasalubong centers are in downtown Cebu City at the corner of V. Gullas and Mabini streets, Don Gil Garcia Street in Capitol, Fuente Osmeña Circle, and along the national highway in the southern town of Barili.</p>
 	      <p><strong>Titay's</strong><br>
 	        Titay's is synonymous with rosquillos, a favorite pasalubong and anytime treat that a young woman by the name of Margarita Frasco or Titay started baking in 1907. More than a century later, Titay's oven continues to produce quality home-baked goodies using artisan methods and with Lola Titay's well-guarded recipe. Titay's products now include torta, penato, ensaimada, pastries, and assorted breads.</p>
 	      <p>The store is Liloan but Titay's products are sold in Cebu's big supermarkets, convenience stores, and many other shops.</p>
 	      <p><strong>Lapu-Lapu Guitars<br>
 	      </strong>If you're pressed for time and you want quality guitar, drop by the showroom (located shortly after you turn left from the First Mandaue-Mactan Bridge) along M.L. Quezon Highway in Lapu-Lapu City on your way to the airport. Several stalls sell quality-crafted guitars from various factories in Lapu-Lapu City. You can buy the guitar at prices much lower than in the big malls.</p>
 	      <p>Another option, if you have the time for it, is to buy from the guitar factories in Barangay Abuno, Lapu-Lapu City. You can find both backyard and established guitar makers in the barangay. The bigger ones are Inday Celia's, Alegre, Lilang's, Susing's, and Jerry's.</p>
 	      <p>Tricycle drivers in Lapu-Lapu and taxi drivers know where the guitar factories are. If you're bringing your own vehicle, then go straight from the old Mandaue-Mactan bridge until you reach Mactan Doctors' Hospital where you take a left turn and continue on until H. Mall where you take a right turn straight for Abuno. You know you're on the right track if you see a big guitar monument on the middle of a crossing as you turn right from H. Mall.</p>
 	      <h3>Bargain shops</h3>
 	      <p><strong>Tabo sa Banay</strong><br>
 	        A bargain in Cebu is synonymous with &quot;Tabo sa Banay,&quot; a gathering of clothing stalls selling inexpensive skirts, shorts, dresses, shawls, and other apparel. Tabo sa Banay is located at a side street that comes between Metro Colon and Best Buy Mart. Street entrance is found along OsmeÒa Boulevard. At Tabo, blouses sold for P500 at the mall may be had for P200 or less at Tabo. </p>
 	      <p>Since the stalls are cramped together in a section of an old building, be prepared to sweat a lot while selecting from a variety of clothing goods from the many stalls. Be sure to check for tears in the items you wish to buy and remember that haggling is allowed, nay required in places like Tabo. Any public transport bound for Metro Gaisano will bring you near Tabo. It is a few meters walk from there. Wear comfortable clothing and leave your valuables at home when you visit Tabo.<br>
